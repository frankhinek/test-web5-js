> ⚠️ WEB5 JS SDK IS CURRENTLY IN TECH PREVIEW ⚠️

The SDK is currently still under active development, but having entered the Tech Preview phase there is now a drive to avoid unnecessary changes unless backwards compatibility is provided. Additional functionality will be added in the lead up to 1.0 final, and modifications will be made to address issues and community feedback.

## Introduction

Web5 consists of the following components:

- Decentralized Identifiers
- Verifiable Credentials
- DWeb Node personal datastores

The SDK sets out to gather the most oft used functionality from all three of these
pillar technologies to provide a simple library that is as close to effortless as
possible.
